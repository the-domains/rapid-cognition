# Ready or not the future is coming! ![Thinking about the future](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ce1e3274-7ce0-458e-8230-496e266cb551.jpg)

No matter what your personal views on the future, it will, in some respects be worse than expected and in others it will be better than expected.
Looking just at wealth and health for a moment, predictions heard this year included: 

* we'll soon have perfect health 
* we'll soon be putting death in the grave 
* we'll soon see health care be unaffordable to those who need it most 
* the world's wealth has grown, even amongst the very poorest, consistently since the 1950's 
* the world's wealth has simply concentrated in the hands of the most wealthy. 

These mixed messages don't actually help anyone, but wonderfully illustrate how the same statistics can be used to promote multiple, even contradictory viewpoints. 

Perhaps most importantly, The Economist ([The Purse of the One Percent][0]) notes that a net worth of $3,650 puts a person in the top 50% of wealth holders world-wide.
To get into the 10% club, only a net worth of $77,000 is required. 

My personal dream for the future is that in 2016 the net worth of the bottom 50% would rise to at least $3,650\.
I think that a number factors currently in place could contribute to make this a reality: 

* _MOOCs_. Okay, so this is my area of work, so I may be biased. Follow the logic for a moment, though. In an inspiring [talk on doubling income][1], Brian Tracy lays out the case for leveraging education to improve income. Thanks to [Coursera][2], [Udacity][3], [Khan Academy][4] and many others, free education is available to every self-starter looking to improve their lot. Location no longer matters. 
* _Crowd sourcing_. Following up on [Kickstarter][5] success, different forms of crowd sourcing are now being used across the globe to finance home grown endeavours. These range from financing education, arts, health and startup projects. This brings the money of the world to those who need it most.
- 
* _Micro-financing_. The most established of opportunities for getting the credit needed to reach higher in business and life, micro-finance has a well-proven track record of improving the lives of the most disenfranchised. Organizations like [Kiva][6] make participation as painless and cheep as $25\.
