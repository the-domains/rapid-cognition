# Arch of Titus: Rome and the Menorah
![Students asking questions during "office hours" ](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/221ac20c-12ef-4050-9b37-d976966c8850.png)

This course on [Coursera.org][0] is new for Yeshiva University and explores Roman, and by extension Western, history and thought using the lens of the arch. It then weaves in the Jewish perspective on the events, people and the arch.

There is much that is good about this course, and that is where my review will focus; as an employee of [Onlea][1], I take courses like this to improve my own craft, not to put others down.

The first thing to catch my attention was the attention paid to videography. The locations chosen to capture Professor Fine are, for the most pant, lush and the well planned. The videography is smooth and well edited, making it easy to watch. I'm not a big fan of capturing a lecture in front of students, as I think it misses much of the potential power of the medium, but I know many students like the feeling of sitting in on a classroom.

The main thing that caught my attention in this course is the variety of settings. Professor Fine uses museum visits, classrooms, talks on a park bench, and even office hours to vary the presentation of material. Student engagement is very important to any course, and this seems like a good way of trying to engage interest.

Office hours is especially interesting. Still thoroughly scripted, the pieces introduce a number of important concepts to the learners taking the course at home: 

* Look! It's okay to ask questions;
* The professor takes questions seriously and will try to answer;
* You should be asking questions, too!

The gold standard in creating a course like this is to convert that majority of students, the lurkers, into active participants. Professor Fine's example of student questioning is a good attempt at doing so. I would be very interested to know if he succeeded.
