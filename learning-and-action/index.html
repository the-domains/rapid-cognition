Over the years, however, the ways I read have changed, and the purposes for reading with them. Recently I've run into a number of readers who illustrate the ways in which I read (or used to read).</p><p>I met a young fellow the other day who informed me that he had read through all the books in the library at his junior high school. I was thoroughly impressed! A little while later, I offered him one of my books to read and was somewhat taken aback when he refused on grounds that it wasn’t the right genre. Now, I didn't imagine for a moment that he went down the rows of books and read each one of them cover-to-cover. Rather, I suspect that he picked his way through the books that his young mind found most interesting.</p><p>This method of reading, engages and stresses the mind only slightly. I liken it to sitting at the gym and watching the TV.</p><p>Traveling on the train I often see young people studying. I notice that there is one group who read by highlighter. Any thing that might be important, any thing that might be on the test, gets highlighted. Some augment the technique with multiple colours. Some augment the technique with sticky notes.</p><p>There is a good probability that some of the information that is getting highlighted will be remembered as disjointed facts. This technique can be likened to doing a single rep on all of the machines at the gym, with whatever weights are left set up by the last person, and then leaving.</p><p>A friend I was meeting for coffee was early the other day, and as I joined him at his table I noticed that he was reading one book and writing in another. He was very dutifully copying passages from the book that he found interesting. As we chatted about the book, he remembered other passages that he felt were important that hadn’t made it into his notes. At another point he could almost remember something he read, but couldn’t find it in his notes. Some people tell me they write in the margins, engaging in a type of dialogue with the author.</p><p>This is much better than highlighting, as the action of writing will help drive long-term memory of the material. This technique can be likened to doing a proper number of sets and reps focused on one machine at the gym, but using a random weight for every rep.</p><p>The next two techniques I have created or amalgamated. I don’t know anyone else who uses these techniques. I mention them only because I have found them extremely useful.</p><p>A few years ago, I took a handful of coins with me when I was reading. After reading a sentence, I forced myself to ask one question about that sentence for every coin in my hand. I started with 2 questions and found it challenging. I slowly worked my way up to 10 questions. On some light fiction, I may choose to ask 10 questions on a paragraph instead of a sentence, but the outcomes are the same.</p><p>I didn’t really expect the changes that happened, and it took a number of months before I really saw some of the most incredible results. Here are the results I saw:</p><ul><li>markedly improved comprehension of the material. The more dense and difficult the better the technique worked; </li><li><p data-grid-id="64244c18-1abe-4bdc-82cc-2146a044abfb">a mental framework for the material emerged that allowed me to see how the pieces fit together; </p></li><li><p>in my daily life, my ability to see through a situation to its core and understand improved dramatically. </p></li></ul><p>Following on the gym analogy, this can be likened to doing a proper number of reps and sets, on a single machine, with a trainer who’s constantly pushing for your best effort.</p><p>Most recently, I have added one more level to my reading. As I read I highlight (red for things I disagree with, green for things I agree with, blue for things that need more thought or exploration). I take notes, often imagining I’m arguing with the author. Once I have finished the material, though, I ask what I need to take forward with me into the world. These precious gems I carefully write into a common book (a blank notebook I carry with me).</p><p>The common book gets reviewed daily, or at least, weekly. I talk to others about the gems in my common book. I use quotes from it in my conversations. When solving problems I look first to my common book for inspiration.</p><p>I believe that this can be likened to doing the best possible workout at the gym, and then going out into the sports arena and proving the quality and value of all the exercise.</p></div></section></div><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="15"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="16"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="17"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="18"><span data-reactid="19"><!-- react-empty: 20 --><h2 data-reactid="21"><a data-reactid="22">Rapid Cognition</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="24"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="25"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="26"></div></section></div></div>
